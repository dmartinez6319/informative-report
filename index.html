          <h2>Artificial Intelligence in the Modern World</h2>
          <p>
            Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly more popular and
            common use in the modern world since it is very accessible through a
            website and as a result is starting to impact and change the way we
            interact with the world. Artificial Intelligence has its many
            benefits such as increasing productivity, solving complex problems,
            organizing data, but all of this comes at a cost.

            It has many issues or problems such as handling very private data
            and the many ethical or moral issues that it is being used for. All
            of these factors in artificial intelligence have made many people
            develop mixed feelings on what role artificial intelligence should
            have in this world. In this report I will go over the many key
            issues around artificial intelligence and how it is impacting
            society in particular education institutions along with presenting
            how artificial intelligence is seen by the school’s perspectives.
            how there are possible solutions and measures taken to use
            artificial intelligence to our advantage without the ethical or
            moral issues it presents.

      <!-- Privacy -->
      <section>
        <div class="text-section">
          <h2>Privacy and Data Concerns</h2>
          <p>
            Artificial intelligence systems usually rely on a large amount of
            personal data to function effectively through answering any
            personalized question. This is what allows artificial intelligence
            to have personalization and almost instant services but at the same
            time it also introduces very big privacy risks. The collection,
            storage, and use of this private data raise concerns about
            unauthorized access, data breaches, and surveillance. In many cases,
            the data collected by artificial intelligence systems can be used in
            ways that individuals might not fully understand or agree to which
            poses a very big ethical and moral problem by the companies that
            create it. Through this source, The political philosophy of AI,
            Coeckelbergh
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://dokumen.pub/the-political-philosophy-of-ai-an-introduction-1nbsped-150954853x-9781509548538.html"
              >(2022)
            </a>
            who is an expert in this field of technology and is highly regarded
            says that "the extensive data collection by AI systems poses threats
            to individual privacy and autonomy". This shows that as artificial
            intelligence becomes more prevalent in many sectors of life keeping
            personal information safe is becoming more crucial than ever.

      <!-- Bias -->
      <section>
        <div class="text-section">
          <h2>Bias and Unfair of Artificial Intelligence responses</h2>
          <p>
            Something that is often not considered when receiving artificial
            intelligence is how the responses are biased depending on various
            factors. Most artificial intelligence developed is reliant on the
            information that its creators train it with and depending on what
            type of information it is given will determine how its interactions
            are made. This type of bias in artificial intelligence is called
            machine learning bias or algorithm bias according to IBM
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-bias"
              >(Holdsworth, 2025)
            </a>
            and could lead to potentially very dangerous outcomes. For example,
            old biased information that artificial intelligence analyzes could
            be used in an interaction which fosters incorrect, outdated, or
            unfair judgements especially with historically marginalized groups.
            This shows that artificial intelligence may lack perspectives or
            morals when making decisions which is something important to
            consider when regulating artificial intelligence.

      <!-- Misuse -->

        <div class="text-section">
          <h2>Misuse of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
          <p>
            Another issue surrounding artificial intelligence is its potential
            misuse. While artificial intelligence has the ability to increase
            productivity in many areas of life, it can also be used for harmful
            or cheating purposes. The risk of artificial intelligence being used
            to manipulate public opinion will be a big problem especially on
            social media to spread lies and track people. Another very big area
            of concern is it being used to gain unfair advantage over others
            especially in schools due to most artificial intelligence being
            capable of answering any question. This is shown through a Vatican
            document as it reports, “merely provide answers instead of prompting
            students to arrive at answers themselves or write text for
            themselves”; which can lead to a failure to develop critical
            thinking skills.”

            </a>
            The innovations of artificial intelligence have brought many use
            cases or benefits, however in the wrong hands for the wrong purpose
            can be very consequential.

      <!-- Perspective on AI -->
      <section>
        <div class="text-section">
          <h2>Perspectives on Artificial Intelligence</h2>
          <p>
            The impact of AI on education has shown varying perspectives among
            educators or instructors. Many teachers recognize the potential
            benefits of artificial intelligence as it enhances personalized
            learning and increases student engagement with school lessons and
            curriculum. According to a report by Imagine Learning
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://www.imaginelearning.com/blog/teachers-perceptions-of-ai-in-the-classroom/"
              >(2024) </a
            >, 55% of surveyed educators view generative artificial intelligence
            as having a positive impact in the classroom, while 88% believe
            artificial intelligence can improve accessibility for students that
            may need extra personalization for their work. However, there are
            still concerns shown with ethical or moral problems of using
            artificial intelligence along with data privacy of educators and
            students. In another survey done by EDUCAUSE, it was reported,
            “respondents also believe that academic dishonesty will increase
            (64%) and that students will trust AI tools too much (60%).”

              >(Robert, 2024)
            </a>
            The role of artificial intelligence in educational institutions is
            uncertain but becomes clearer as shown next in a case study under
            regulation.

      <!-- Case Study on AI -->
      <section>
        <div class="text-section">
          <h2>Case Study on Artificial Intelligence</h2>
          <p>
            The use of artificial intelligence in educational settings can offer
            significant benefits despite its possible ethical misuse if it is
            regulated and balanced right as shown from this case study, The AI
            Assessment Scale (AIAS) in action: A pilot implementation of
            genai-supported assessment
            <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.14742/ajet.9434"
              >(2024) </a
            >. This case study went over how artificial intelligence supported
            assessments can help multiple educational institutions by providing
            "more efficient and personalized learning experiences"
            <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.14742/ajet.9434"
              >(2024) </a
            >. Through integrating artificial intelligence in the school and
            monitoring how students interacted with it, the school was able to
            significantly increase student scores while preventing moral and
            ethical issues of misuse. This has shown that artificial
            intelligence can be of some benefit to society as shown from this
            study in a school setting if action is done to make sure regulations
            are set in place to prevent moral or ethical issues that it comes
            with.

          <h2>Regulation of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
          <p>
            As artificial intelligence technology advances, governments
            worldwide have started implementing policies to address ethical,
            safety, and transparency concerns. The European Union has taken a
            significant step by laying down the AI Act, which regulates
            artificial intelligence by ensuring artificial intelligence are
            systems designed to be safe, fair, and managed with human oversight

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            In conclusion, while artificial intelligence can offer a great deal
            of benefits, such as increased productivity and personalized
            learning, its ethical or moral problems must be considered and not
            overlooked. The different views or perspectives on artificial
            intelligence in education show the need for balanced regulation to
            make sure it’s responsibly used. By paying attention to these
            problems, artificial intelligence can be used to potentially improve
            society without its moral and ethical problems. As technology
            continues to improve, it is important to be attentive to the changes
            that shape our world such as artificial intelligence.
