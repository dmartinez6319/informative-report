          <h2>Artificial Intelligence in the Modern World</h2>
          <p>
            Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly more popular and
            common use in the modern world since it is very accessible through a
            website and as a result is starting to impact and change the way we
            interact with the world. Artificial Intelligence has its many
            benefits such as increasing productivity, solving complex problems,
            organizing data, but all of this comes at a cost. It has many issues
            such as handling very private data and the many ethical or moral
            issues that it is being used for. In this report I will go over the
            many key issues around artificial intelligence and how it is
            impacting society in particular education institutions and go over
            some of the measures already taken to use artificial intelligence to
            our advantage without the ethical or moral issues that is present in
            it.

          <h2>Privacy and Data Concerns</h2>
          <p>
            Artificial intelligence systems usually rely on a large amount of
            personal data to function effectively through answering any
            personalized question. This is what allows artificial intelligence
            to have personalization and almost instant services but at the same
            time it also introduces very big privacy risks. The collection,
            storage, and use of this private data raise concerns about
            unauthorized access, data breaches, and surveillance. In many cases,
            the data collected by artificial intelligence systems can be used in
            ways that individuals might not fully understand or agree to which
            poses a very big ethical and moral problem by the companies that
            create it. Through this source, The political philosophy of AI,
            Coeckelbergh
            <a

              href="https://dokumen.pub/the-political-philosophy-of-ai-an-introduction-1nbsped-150954853x-9781509548538.html"
              >(2022)
            </a>
            who is an expert in this field of technology and is highly regarded
            says that "the extensive data collection by AI systems poses threats
            to individual privacy and autonomy". This shows that as artificial
            intelligence becomes more prevalent in many sectors of life keeping
            personal information safe is becoming more crucial than ever.

          <h2>Misuse of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
          <p>
            Another issue surrounding artificial intelligence is its potential
            misuse. While artificial intelligence has the ability to increase
            productivity in many areas of life, it can also be used for harmful
            or cheating purposes. The risk of artificial intelligence being used
            to manipulate public opinion will be a big problem especially on
            social media to spread lies and track people. As Coeckelbergh
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://dokumen.pub/the-political-philosophy-of-ai-an-introduction-1nbsped-150954853x-9781509548538.html"
              >(2022)
            </a>
            says, "The uncritical deployment of AI systems can lead to harmful
            consequences, from surveillance to social manipulation." Another
            very big area of concern is it being used to gain unfair advantage
            over others especially in schools due to most artificial
            intelligence being capable of answering any question. This is why
            policies and regulation should be considered or looked at as
            artificial intelligence continues to pose many ethical and moral
            issues.
