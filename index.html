          <h2>Artificial Intelligence in the Modern World</h2>
          <p>
            Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly more popular and
            common use in the modern world since it is very accessible through a
            website and as a result is starting to impact and change the way we
            interact with the world. Artificial Intelligence has its many
            benefits such as increasing productivity, solving complex problems,
            organizing data, but all of this comes at a cost. It has many issues
            such as handling very private data and the many ethical or moral
            issues that it is being used for. In this report I will go over the
            many key issues around artificial intelligence and how it is
            impacting society in particular education institutions and how there
            are possible solutions and measures taken to use artificial
            intelligence to our advantage without the ethical or moral issues it
            presents.
